DataScience_Algorithms_and_Projects

## This repository is intended to break down machine learning algorith in base format along with a project attached to it. This is an ongoing effort 
## Ongoing as of 05/13/2025


# Steps to Run the Codes 
# End to end DataScience Algorithm

## Workflows

1. Update config.yaml
2. Update params.yaml
3. Update entity
4. Update the configuration manager in src config
5. update the conponents
6. update the pipeline
7. update the main.py
8. update the app.py


## Basic Concept Code using OOPs concepts are stored in Research folder along with the logic being implemented in a pipeline manner 
1. Linear Regression: <https://github.com/furkhansuhail/DataScience_Algorithms_and_Projects/blob/main/research/LinearRegression_OOPS.py>
2. Logistic Regression: <https://github.com/furkhansuhail/DataScience_Algorithms_and_Projects/blob/main/research/LogisticRegression_OOPS.py>
